## Installation

### Global Installation

Install globally with bun:

#### bun (global install)

```bash
bun add -g @akiojin/claude-worktree
```

### One-time Usage

Run without installation using bunx:

#### bunx (bun)

```bash
bunx @akiojin/claude-worktree
```

## Quick Start

Run in any Git repository:

```bash
# If installed globally
claude-worktree

# Or use bunx for one-time execution
bunx @akiojin/claude-worktree
```

The CLI currently supports only the help option:

```bash
claude-worktree --help
```

To view usage information, run `claude-worktree --help`.

The tool presents an interactive interface with the following options:

1. **Select Existing Branch**: Choose from local or remote branches with worktree auto-creation
2. **Create New Branch**: Guided branch creation with type selection (feature/hotfix/release)
3. **Manage Worktrees**: View, open, or remove existing worktrees
4. **Cleanup Merged PRs**: Automatically remove branches and worktrees for merged GitHub pull requests

## Advanced Workflows

### Branch Creation Workflow

> **Important**: This workflow is intended for human developers. Autonomous agents must never create or delete branches unless a human gives explicit, task-specific instructions.

1. Select "Create new branch" from the main menu
2. Choose branch type (feature, hotfix, release)
3. Enter branch name with automatic prefix application
4. Select base branch from available options
5. Confirm worktree creation path
6. Automatic worktree setup and selected tool launch

### Worktree Management

- **Open Existing**: Launch the selected tool in existing worktrees
- **Remove Worktree**: Clean removal with optional branch deletion
- **Batch Operations**: Handle multiple worktrees efficiently

### GitHub Integration

- **Merged PR Cleanup**: Automatically detect and remove merged pull request branches
- **Authentication Check**: Verify GitHub CLI setup before operations
- **Remote Sync**: Fetch latest changes before cleanup operations

### Automated PR Merge

The repository includes an automated PR merge workflow that streamlines the development process:

- **Automatic Merge**: PRs are automatically merged when all CI checks (Test, Lint) pass and there are no conflicts
- **Merge Method**: Uses merge commit to preserve full commit history
- **Smart Skip Logic**: Automatically skips draft PRs, conflicted PRs, and failed CI runs
- **Target Branches**: Active for PRs targeting `main` and `develop` branches
- **Safety First**: Respects branch protection rules and requires successful CI completion

**How it works:**
1. PR is created targeting `main` or `develop`
2. CI workflows (Test, Lint) run automatically
3. When all CI checks pass and no conflicts exist, the PR is automatically merged
4. No manual intervention required - just create the PR and let CI handle the rest

**Disabling auto-merge:**
- Create PRs as drafts to prevent auto-merge: `gh pr create --draft`
- The auto-merge workflow respects this setting and will skip draft PRs

For technical details, see [specs/SPEC-cff08403/](specs/SPEC-cff08403/).

## System Requirements

- **Bun**: >= 1.0.0
- **Node.js** (optional): Recommended >= 18.0.0 when working with Node-based tooling
- **Git**: Latest version with worktree support
- **AI Tool**: At least one of Claude Code or Codex CLI should be available
- **GitHub CLI**: Required for PR cleanup features (optional)
- **Python**: >= 3.11 (for Spec Kit CLI)
- **uv**: Python package manager (for Spec Kit CLI)

## Spec-Driven Development with Spec Kit

This project uses **@akiojin/spec-kit**, a Japanese-localized version of GitHub's Spec Kit for spec-driven development workflows.

### Installing Spec Kit CLI

```bash
# Install globally with uv
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/akiojin/spec-kit.git

# Verify installation
specify --help
````

### Available Spec Kit Commands

Execute these commands in Claude Code to leverage spec-driven development:

- `/speckit.constitution` - Define project principles and guidelines
- `/speckit.specify` - Create feature specifications
- `/speckit.plan` - Create technical implementation plans
- `/speckit.tasks` - Generate actionable task lists
- `/speckit.implement` - Execute implementation

### Optional Quality Assurance Commands

- `/speckit.clarify` - Resolve ambiguities before planning
- `/speckit.analyze` - Validate consistency between spec, plan, and tasks
- `/speckit.checklist` - Verify requirement coverage and clarity

### Spec Kit Workflow

1. Start with `/speckit.constitution` to establish project foundations
2. Use `/speckit.specify` to define what you want to build
3. Run `/speckit.plan` to create technical architecture
4. Generate tasks with `/speckit.tasks`
5. Implement with `/speckit.implement`

For more details, see the [Spec Kit documentation](https://github.com/akiojin/spec-kit).

## Release Process

This project uses **semantic-release** for automated version management, changelog generation, and npm publishing. Releases are automatically triggered when pull requests are merged to the `main` branch.

### How Releases Work

1. **Commit with Conventional Commits**: Use standardized commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:`)
2. **Merge to Main**: PR merge triggers GitHub Actions
3. **Automatic Versioning**: semantic-release analyzes commits and determines version
   - `feat:` → minor version (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
   - `fix:` → patch version (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
   - `BREAKING CHANGE:` → major version (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
4. **CHANGELOG Update**: Automatically generates CHANGELOG.md updates
5. **npm Publish**: Publishes to npm registry
6. **GitHub Release**: Creates release with notes

### Conventional Commits

semantic-release uses commit messages to determine release types:

| Type                                              | Description     | Version Impact        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| `feat:`                                           | New feature     | minor (1.0.0 → 1.1.0) |
| `fix:`                                            | Bug fix         | patch (1.0.0 → 1.0.1) |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:`                                | Breaking change | major (1.0.0 → 2.0.0) |
| `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:` | No release      | -                     |

**Example commits**:

```bash
# Feature (minor release)
git commit -m "feat: add session management feature"

# Bug fix (patch release)
git commit -m "fix: resolve Docker path handling issue"

# Breaking change (major release)
git commit -m "feat!: require Bun 1.0+

BREAKING CHANGE: npx support removed, bunx required"
```

### Configuration Files

#### .releaserc.json

The semantic-release configuration file defines the release process:

```json
{
  "branches": ["main"],
  "tagFormat": "v${version}",
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/changelog",
    "@semantic-release/npm",
    "@semantic-release/git",
    "@semantic-release/github"
  ]
}
```

For detailed configuration specifications, see [specs/SPEC-23bb2eed/data-model.md](./specs/SPEC-23bb2eed/data-model.md).

#### GitHub Actions Workflow

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs whenever either condition is met:

1. A commit is pushed to `main`
2. The **Auto Merge** workflow finishes successfully for `main`

Each execution performs the following steps:

1. Run tests (`bun run test`)
2. Build project (`bun run build`)
3. Execute semantic-release (version, changelog, publish)

> **Secrets required:**  
> - `NPM_TOKEN` – npm publish token with `automation` scope  
> - `SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN` – GitHub personal access token (classic) with `repo` scope. After registering the secret, add the tokenの所有ユーザー、または「Allow GitHub Actions to bypass branch protection」を `main` ブランチ保護ルールに設定し、リリースコミットの push が拒否されないようにしてください。シークレットが存在しない場合、ワークフローは早期に失敗します。

### Manual Verification

To verify the release configuration locally:

```bash
# Dry-run to test configuration
node node_modules/semantic-release/bin/semantic-release.js --dry-run
```

> **Note:** semantic-release v25 requires Node.js 22.14+ even when the project itself uses Bun. The GitHub Actions workflow installs this version automatically; run the same locally before invoking the command above.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Errors**: Ensure Claude Code has proper directory permissions
**Git Worktree Conflicts**: Use the cleanup feature to remove stale worktrees
**GitHub Authentication**: Run `gh auth login` before using PR cleanup features
**Bun Version**: Verify Bun >= 1.0.0 with `bun --version`

### Debug Mode

For verbose output, set the environment variable:

```bash
DEBUG=claude-worktree claude-worktree
```
